Hello Everyone!! This is my first rodeo on Github, I find it amazing and at the same time a little confusing.. 
I'm sure I'll get a hang of things gradually!
I'm about to make my first "update README.md" file commit, Adios!!!
Here I am again with a little changes!
Unfortunately I came accross some difficulties.
I'd love to try again.
Let's go!
